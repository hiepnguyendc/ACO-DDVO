# ACO-SDVO_Formulation-1
ACO-SDVO is a tool coded by FORTRAN to support for optimization of irrigation scheduling. It represents the irrigation scheduling problem in the form of a decision tree and use ant colony optimization (ACO) as the optimization engine. It uses static decision variable options and penalty functions during the optimization process. 

ACO-DDVO_Formulation-1 considers only one decision variable (i.e. crop type) and the input data for it are stored in the branch "Input_Data".
